This is pretty much [AnySoftKeyboard/LanguagePack](https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/LanguagePack)
Spanish branch, but without all the clutter I need (such as a Catalonia keyboard- who needs that?).

It also has a lot of accents and other fuzzy stuff I love typing just for fun. If you're using
my GitHub as my CV, please proceed! I have a lot of more interesting projects over
[here](https://github.com/LonamiWebs).
